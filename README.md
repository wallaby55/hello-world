Hello World. This is my debut on GitHub. Currently I am working on a post-grad degree in Computer Science. My Bachelor's is in the Arts - Psychology and Sociology. The Arts teach you how to think, but provide very little practical skills. And so I have deciced to learn to program, where I will put my thinking skills to use at massive scale. 

After roaming around GitHub for a few hours this morning, something tells me I may not even need to recieve a formal education in Computer Science to learn how to program well. GitHub appears to be an ocean of knowledge. 

The seed has been planted, watch it grow!
